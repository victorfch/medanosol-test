# Medano Solution Test App

## Installed packages

- React
- React Router Dom
- Material-UI
- Axios
- React-query (optional use)
- React Hook Forms (optional use, for the search field, for example)

## Requirements

- Use Yarn
- Use Material-UI to build the interface
- Use functional components (React hooks) not classes!.
- Responsive design
- Use React-Router-Dom for navigation

## Optional (Additional points)

- Use React-Query for API requests - [Get started](https://react-query.tanstack.com/overview)
- Use React Hook Forms - [Get started](https://react-hook-form.com/get-started)
- Transition and develop with Typescript - [Adding Typescript](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/)
- Use i18n for some translations, like the navigation links (a simple integration test) - [Docs](https://www.i18next.com/)
- Use React Context for data managment (as a replacement for Redux)
- Deploy the project to netlify or similar for easy access.

## Objectives

- Use [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) as a source of data to create the test app
- Create a home page, listing all pokemons
- Add a search bar in the home page to filter the results by name (or any other relevant data optionally)
- Create a details page, accessible by clicking on a pokemon
- Create a navigation bar to 2 sample pages with some sample text (optionally use the opportunity to display more information)
- Create a footer for all pages
- Feel free to improve the sample in any way

## Our guidelines

- Reuse components
- Keep the code easy to read
- Code in english
- Avoid prop drilling
- Propper use of react hooks
- Basic attention to UX/UI
- Separation of concerns
- Clean structure
- Profit from new ES6+ features





# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
